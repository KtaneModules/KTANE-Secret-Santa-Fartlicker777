  description: "Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It is
    like this\r tangible thing that you can point to and say, \u201CHey man, I love
    you this many\r dollars worth.\u201D\r\n\nFind what's inside each present by shaking
    the bomb, and find which one is outside the price range.\n\nThanks to Vincology
    for the manual.\n\nManual can be found at ktane.timwi.de or in the manuals folder
    of your game.\n\nIf there are any bugs, contact Fartlicker777#9169 on Discord."
